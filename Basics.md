- OnCreate : When an activity is created, it will call the function **OnCreate**.
   - It is the first function that gets called.
   - OnCreate is a function which we prepare to show a particular UI or to prepare some functionality while some instance is still coming up.
  
- The area which we sees in the application is called **ViewPort**.
- **Build** means that our application is **processing all the instructions** that we added to our program files and it will output an **object file** out of it.
   - we give Object file to our **virtual machine** which helps convert that file into low level instructions to be executed by the machine.

- Gradle : It is an **open source build pipeline** that helps us build projects that are dependent on them.
