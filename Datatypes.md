- Number types are divided into two groups:

  - Integer types store whole numbers, positive or negative (such as 123 or -456), without decimals. Valid types are **Byte, Short, Int and Long.**

  - Floating point types represent numbers with a fractional part, containing one or more decimals. There are two types: **Float and Double.**

- **Byte** : The Byte data type can store whole numbers from -128 to 127. 
- **Short** : The Short data type can store whole numbers from -32768 to 32767.
- **Int** : The Int data type can store whole numbers from -2147483648 to 2147483647.
- **Long** : The Long data type can store whole numbers from -9223372036854775807 to 9223372036854775807. This is used when Int is not large enough to store the value. 
Optionally, you can end the value with an "L".

- The precision of Float is only **6 or 7 decimal digits, while Double variables have a precision of about 15 digits.**
  Therefore it is safer to use Double for most calculations.
