/* Points to remember:

1. We can’t create an object for abstract class.
2. All the variables (properties) and member functions of an abstract class are by default non-abstract. So, if we want to override 
these members in the child class, then we need to use open keyword.
3. If we declare a member function as abstract then we does not need to annotate with open keyword because these are open by default.
4. An abstract member function doesn’t have a body, and it must be implemented in the derived class.         */
